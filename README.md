# Quasi-categories in Lean

The general goal of this project is to formalize basic theory of quasi-categories. Most of the work is based on [Kerodon](https://kerodon.net/).

The current goal is [0066](https://kerodon.net/tag/0066): the internal hom between quasi-categories is again a quasi-category. This has been reduced to [0077](https://kerodon.net/tag/0077) and [007F](https://kerodon.net/tag/007F).
