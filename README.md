# Quasi-categories in Lean

The general goal of this project is to formalize basic theory of quasi-categories. Most of the work is based on [Kerodon](https://kerodon.net/).

The current goal is [0066](https://kerodon.net/tag/0066): the internal hom between quasi-categories is again a quasi-category. This has been reduced to [0077](https://kerodon.net/tag/0077) and [007F](https://kerodon.net/tag/007F).

Remaining tasks:

### [0077](https://kerodon.net/tag/0077):
- [x] the collection of monomorphisms of simplicial sets is stable under transfinite composition (done by @joelriou)
- [x] monomorphisms are generated (in the weakly saturated sense) by boundary inclusions $\partial\Delta^n \hookrightarrow \Delta^n$ (done by @joelriou)

### [007F](https://kerodon.net/tag/007F):
- [ ] the pushout-product of $\partial\Delta^n \hookrightarrow \Delta^n$ with $\Lambda^2_1 \hookrightarrow \Delta^2$ is inner anodyne (being worked on in [this repository](https://github.com/mckoen/topcat-model-category))

### [01BR](https://kerodon.net/tag/01BR):
- [ ] the class of inner anodyne morphisms is generated by inner horn inclusions (should be done when [#20245](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/pull/20245) is merged)
