# Quasicategories in Lean

The general goal of this project is to formalize the basic theory of quasicategories in Lean. Most of the work is based on [Kerodon](https://kerodon.net/).

The current goal is [0066](https://kerodon.net/tag/0066). This has been reduced to [0077](https://kerodon.net/tag/0077) and [007F](https://kerodon.net/tag/007F) (two very technical proofs).

Remaining tasks:

### 0077:
- [ ] the collection of monomorphisms is stable under transfinite composition
- [ ] the maps $B(k - 1) \hookrightarrow B(k)$ belong to $T'$ (requires simplicial subset and skeleton API)

### 007F:
- [ ] $S$ is stable under transfinite composition
- [ ] the pushout product of $\partial\Delta^m \hookrightarrow \Delta^m$ and $\Lambda^2_1 \hookrightarrow \Delta^2$ is inner anodyne for $0 \le m$ (requires simplicial subset API)

### Misc:
- [ ] the class of inner anodyne morphisms is generated by inner horn inclusions
